# Factorio - Nifty's Logistic Train Network
I made a few minor changes and fixed a bug with Optera's mod to be able to use it in the GreyGoo project. See the changelog for details.

Factorio mod  adding "logistic-train-stops" acting as anchor points for building a train powered logistic network.<br/>
It can handle multiple train configurations and will pick the best available train for a delivery.<br/>
With Choumiko's RailTanker it will also deliver liquids.<br/>
